# os1 External References

This document consolidates the external standards, manuals, specifications, RFCs, and other authoritative public references that matter most to `os1`. It is the central entry point for external technical knowledge that complements the local project documents: [README](../README.md) for build and workflow, [GOALS](../GOALS.md) for long-term direction, and [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the repository's current live system contract.

The list is curated rather than exhaustive. It favors primary sources first: official standards bodies, vendor manuals, protocol specifications, and normative registries. Where a foundational specification is membership-gated or historically difficult to obtain publicly, this guide points to the nearest official public landing page or the most authoritative open reference that is practical for project work.

## Secondary References Worth Keeping Nearby

These are not the first documents to trust over a specification, but they are exceptionally useful after the normative material above:

- [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/): Excellent conceptual grounding for scheduling, virtual memory, filesystems, and concurrency.
- [Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment](https://www.apuebook.com/): One of the best practical references for POSIX process, file, signal, and terminal behavior.

## Maintenance Notes

- When a local subsystem document cites an external spec repeatedly, add that external reference here first and then point the subsystem doc back to this file.
- Prefer versioned specification links when the revision materially changes behavior (`ACPI`, `virtio`, `NVMe`, `RFC 9293` versus old TCP RFCs).
- If an external standard is not publicly available, document the closest official public entry point and explain the limitation briefly rather than silently omitting the domain.
