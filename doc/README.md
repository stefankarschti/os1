# os1 Documentation Map

This file is the complete map of repository documentation. It distinguishes
live contracts from plans, implemented designs, reviews, drafts, and historical
context. Source code and executable checks are authoritative when a historical
document describes an older tree.

## Repository Entry Points

- [Agent map](../AGENTS.md) — concise operating contract for coding agents.
- [README](../README.md) — project overview and build/run/test instructions.
- [Goals](../GOALS.md) — long-term product direction and sequencing.

## Live Contracts

These documents must describe the current tree and should be updated with any
change to their contract.

- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) — implemented system shape, subsystem
  ownership, runtime flow, and mechanically enforced boundaries.
- [References](REFERENCES.md) — curated external specifications and standards.
- [Latest review](latest-review.md) — stable pointer to the newest
  source-grounded review and its carried-forward gaps.
- [Quality and validation coverage](QUALITY.md) — evidence-linked subsystem
  coverage, artifact interpretation, and explicit gaps.
- [Technical debt ledger](TECH_DEBT.md) — live owners, prerequisites, and next
  actions for repeated architectural findings.
- [Major dependency contract](DEPENDENCIES.md) — exact pins, adapter boundaries,
  upgrade procedures, footprint references, and fallback implications.
- [Staged agent autonomy](AUTONOMY.md) — capability ladder, permanent human
  judgment boundaries, and the completed Level 2 pilot.

## Playbooks

- [Smoke failure triage](playbooks/smoke-failure-triage.md) — preserve and
  classify JSON/log evidence, reproduce narrowly, route ownership, and validate
  without retrying away timing failures.

## Current Proposals

- [Harness engineering proposal](2026-08-19-harness-engineering-proposal.md) —
  Phase A/B implementation record and proposal for compounding
  repository-harness maintenance.

## Execution Plans

- [Execution-plan lifecycle](exec-plans/README.md) — when a checked-in plan is
  required and how it moves from active to completed.
- [Execution-plan template](exec-plans/_template.md) — required structure for
  new multi-step plans.

Active plans live in `doc/exec-plans/active/`; completed plans move to
`doc/exec-plans/completed/`. Existing historical plans remain at their current
paths to avoid link churn. There are currently no active execution plans.

## Decisions

- [ADR-001 — Scheduled Health Report Policy](decisions/001-scheduled-health-report-policy.md) —
  reuse the authoritative CI environment and publish advisory findings only as
  artifacts.

## Implemented Designs and Plans

- [Phase C — Compounding Maintenance](exec-plans/completed/2026-08-19-phase-c-compounding-maintenance.md) —
  blocking drift checks, scheduled advisory health evidence, a smoke-triage
  playbook, and the bounded Level 2 pilot.
- [Phase B — Harness Legibility](exec-plans/completed/2026-08-19-phase-b-legibility.md) —
  structured smoke evidence and live quality, debt, and dependency records.
- [Milestone 1: Boot Contract and Kernel Stabilization](2026-04-22-milestone-1-boot-contract-and-kernel-stabilization.md)
- [Milestone 2: Process Model and Isolation](2026-04-22-milestone-2-process-model-and-isolation.md)
- [Milestone 3: Modern Default Boot Path](2026-04-22-milestone-3-modern-default-boot-path.md)
- [Milestone 4: Modern Platform Support](2026-04-22-milestone-4-modern-platform-support.md)
- [Milestone 5: Interactive Shell and Observability](2026-04-23-milestone-5-interactive-shell-and-observability.md)
- [Source Tree Refactor](2026-04-26-source-tree-refactor.md)
- [Kernel Source Tree Reorganization Plan](2026-04-27-kernel-source-tree-reorganization-plan.md)
- [Modern C++ Source Reorganization Plan](2026-04-27-modern-cpp-source-reorganization-plan.md)
- [Higher-Half Migration](2026-04-28-higher-half-migration.md)
- [Driver, Device, and Platform Implementation Plan](2026-04-29-driver-device-platform-implementation-plan.md)
- [Host Test Harness Plan](2026-04-29-host-test-harness-plan.md)
- [Limine Shim Decomposition](2026-04-29-limine-shim-decomposition.md)
- [SMP Synchronization Contract](2026-04-29-smp-synchronization-contract.md)
- [Kernel Small-Object Allocator](2026-05-04-kernel-small-object-allocator.md)
- [Phased SMP Enablement](2026-05-05-phased-smp-enablement.md)
- [SMP Enablement Review](2026-05-05-smp-enablement-review.md)
- [ACPICA Integration](2026-05-06-acpica-integration.md)

These files preserve rationale and implementation history. Their status notes
identify whether later live contracts supersede any details.

## Reviews

Read [latest-review.md](latest-review.md) first. Dated reviews are snapshots of
the commit they inspected, not live contracts.

## Draft Interfaces

The files under `os-api-draft/` are design exploration, not the live kernel ABI.

- [Draft index](os-api-draft/README.md)
- [Native Object/Kernel Contract](os-api-draft/native_object_kernel_contract.md)
- [Object-Oriented VFS Specification](os-api-draft/object_oriented_vfs_spec.md)
- [ELF Interface Specification](os-api-draft/elf_interface_spec.md)
- [os1 Shell Language First Draft](os-api-draft/os1-shell-language-first-draft.md)

## Document Lifecycle

New documents use this lightweight metadata:

```text
Status: proposed | active | implemented | superseded | historical
Owner: subsystem or maintainer
Last verified: YYYY-MM-DD at commit
Supersedes / superseded by: optional relative link
```

Rules:

1. Update this index in the same change that adds, moves, or removes Markdown.
2. Do not rewrite historical reviews to match current code; update live contracts.
3. Mark a plan implemented or superseded when work ends and preserve decisions.
4. Prefer links to source and executable evidence over duplicated descriptions.
5. Run `tools/verify.sh fast` to validate the index and live-document links.
